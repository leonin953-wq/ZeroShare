**ZeroShare** is a next-generation, browser-based file-sharing utility. It establishes a direct, peer-to-peer (P2P) tunnel between two devices, allowing them to exchange data of any size without intermediate cloud storage. Before any data leaves your device, it is encrypted using military-grade **AES-256-GCM**.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture:** Your files never touch a server. They are transferred directly from Browser A to Browser B.
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** Utilizes the native Web Crypto API for ECDH key exchange and AES-256-GCM chunk encryption.
- **No File Size Limits:** Instead of loading massive files into RAM, ZeroShare reads, encrypts, and streams data in 64KB chunks, preventing browser crashes on mobile devices.
- **NAT Traversal:** Built-in Google STUN and Metered TURN servers guarantee connections punch through strict corporate and mobile firewalls.
- **Local History Log:** Keeps a private, local record of your transfers and connections using `localStorage`.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Fully installable on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive Glassmorphism design with system-aware Dark Mode and smooth CSS animations.

## 🏗️ How It Works (The Architecture)

ZeroShare combines two powerful web technologies to achieve secure, serverless transfers:

1. **The Handshake (WebRTC & PeerJS):** When two users enter a matching 6-character room code, PeerJS uses a lightweight signaling server to exchange their IP addresses (SDP offers). Once connected, the signaling server drops out, and a direct WebRTC `RTCDataChannel` is opened.
2. **The Key Exchange (ECDH):** Before sending files, both browsers generate an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (P-256) keypair. They swap public keys over the P2P tunnel to mathematically derive the exact same shared secret key.
3. **The Transfer (AES-GCM):**
   The sender's browser slices the file into 64KB chunks. Each chunk is encrypted with the shared AES key and a unique Initialization Vector (IV), sent over the WebRTC channel, and decrypted on the fly by the receiver.

## 💻 Local Setup & Installation

Because ZeroShare is a 100% client-side application, running it locally requires zero build tools or dependencies.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/kdippan/zeroshare.git](https://github.com/kdippan/zeroshare.git)

 * Open the folder:
   ```cd zeroshare```

 * Run a local server:
   You can use Live Server in VS Code, or Python's built-in HTTP server:
   ```python -m http.server 8000```

 * Open your browser:
   Navigate to ```http://localhost:8000```
